Problem Statement: 

You've been tasked with creating a flexible infrastructure for an eco-friendly car-sharing service. The service should automatically adapt to varying usage demands while keeping costs in check.



Guidelines/Goals:

Create EC2 Instances and Load Balancer:

Launch EC2 instances using a predefined AMI.
Create an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic.
Set Up Auto Scaling:

Create an Auto Scaling Group for the EC2 instances.
Configure scaling policies to add or remove instances based on CPU utilization.
Optimize Costs:

Implement scaling policies that consider cost optimization.
Use Auto Scaling to minimize instances during periods of low demand.
